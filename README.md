A set of delightfully nifty tools for exploration

## Recall potion

A recreation of recall potion from Terraria in Minecraft. You drink it, and you get teleported to your spawn point.
As simple as that!

## Illumination necklace

Both pretty and  functional - wear it to place luminous orbs automatically in dark spots wherever you go.
Compatible with Flan & Get Off My Lawn!

## Assortment pouch

Adventurers often face a problem that they encounter a lot of unique items in low quantities.
This pouch solves the problem - it has a lot of slots, but each slot can only hold a single item.

## Mysteries and Mystery arrows

Ever wondered what lives inside an NPC? The answer is a mystery. Unalive a couple dozen villagers, pillagers,
witches or other NPCs to get your mystery. The primary application of mysteries, apart from being pretty,
is making mystery arrows from plain arrows. Mystery arrows are really quite useful. Shoot one at a block, and it changes.
Shoot one at a creature, and it morphs.

### Ownerizer

Mystery arrows respect Flan / GOML claims by default. Among other things, it means that if you put them into
a dispenser, they won't work inside *any* claim, even your own. (Sadly, that's just a Minecraft limitation)
\
\
BUT! There's a solution: Ownerizer! Just shift-click a dispenser (or any other functional block) with it
to mark it as your own property. It won't do anything on its own, but it will hint Mystery arrows that they can
unleash their power inside your claims (and maybe even more!?).

### How to configure Mystery arrows

Mystery arrows come opinionated. To configure them, you need to make a datapack.
Look here on what to put where [for blocks](https://github.com/falseresync/explorers-delight/tree/8724089bbcee75e4d8bbb1d07571399d7ead7ecc/src/main/resources/data/exdel/tags/blocks/mystery_arrow) and [for entities](https://github.com/falseresync/explorers-delight/tree/8724089bbcee75e4d8bbb1d07571399d7ead7ecc/src/main/resources/data/exdel/tags/entity_types/mystery_arrow).
Additionally, there's a config for the weights (that means relative chances) of some mystery arrow effects.
The config structure is self-explanatory, go check it out
